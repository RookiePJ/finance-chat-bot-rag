# Blockchain Glossary Chat Bot with RAG 
Note and disclaimer - this project is based on the original code forked from 'Build a RAG Application' by David Grey
(https://github.com/gitdagray/nextjs-rag-langchain)

### Description
A simple AI chatbot which will use retrieval augmented generation to 
answer user questions containing blockchain related terms in order to provide descriptions of those terms.  

### Simple Use Case
#### Overview: As a user I want to be able to find the definition of a blockchain term.

- When I enter a term that is used in the blockchain/web3/cryptocurrency content I want to be provided with its basic definition.
- If the term is found within the loaded RAG document then that definition will be provided to the model in order to give the user an answer
- If the term is not found within the RAG document then the answer will be provided by the model 
- Any other unrelated will be answered by the model.
