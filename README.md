# Blockchain Glossary Chat Bot with RAG 
Note and disclaimer - this project is based on the original code forked from 'Build a RAG Application' by David Grey
(https://github.com/gitdagray/nextjs-rag-langchain)

### Description
A simple AI chatbot which will use retrieval augmented generation to 
answer user questions containing blockchain related terms in order to provide descriptions of those terms.  

### Simple Use Case
#### Overview: As a user I want to be able to find the definition of a blockchain term.

- When I enter a term that is used in the blockchain/web3/cryptocurrency content I want to be provided with its basic definition.
- If the term is found within the loaded RAG document then that definition will be provided to the model in order to give the user an answer
- If the term is not found within the RAG document then the answer will be provided by the model 
- Any other unrelated will be answered by the model. 

### âš™ Usage and setup
#### Setup and configuration
- Clone the repository  
- Provide your own .env.local file with an OpenAI API key (OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>)
- Install dependencies using the command: npm install

#### To run the web applicaion locally
- Run the application using the command: run: npm run dev
- Open a web browser at the following address:  http://localhost:3000

### To Do
- [X] Install and run locally
- [X] Run with OpenAI
- [X] Create RAG crypto glossary document
- [X] Crate new route to receive an answer from the model using the RAG document
- [X] Amend the text on various web pages 
- [X] Do basic End to End testing (no idea how to write unit or integration tests!)
- [X] Document the new code (old school, old habits die hard!)
- [X] Create/Amend project documentation (this document)
- [ ] TODO Amend to work locally with the text-generation-webui api 
- [ ] TODO Add the ability to process PDF documents, turn them into a langchain vector
