    "description": "A bockchain is a digital ledger that includes immutable, information documented in blocks.  Each new block is then chained to the previous block by leveraging a cryptographic hash function. This ledger can be shared publicly.  It is impossible to change the information that has been written within existing blocks."
  },
  {
    "term": "block",
    "description": "Information is written permanently to a blockchain network with the help data structures know as blocks. A single block is a record of timestamped information, network transactions that have been added to the network. Each block includes a hash of the content of the previous block."
  },
  {
    "term": "distributed ledger",
    "description": "A distributed ledger is a type of immutable datastore that can be shared, and can synchronize across nodes within a blockchain network. The distributed ledger holds transactions which detail the exchange of data or assets between actors on the network.  Consensus within the network helps to ensure consistent information among the network actors in ensuring governance."
  },
  {
    "term": "consensus",
    "description": "Consensus is a collaborative method that is performed by validators/miners on a blockchain network to verify the validity of transactions before they are written. This is essential in blockchains in order to maintain consistent synchronization of the information. Validators or miners have to agree on new blocks of transactions and verify their contents before they are written.  Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are common consensus methods."

  {
    "term": "smart contract",
    "description": "A smart contract is a program that is written as executable code onto a blockchain. Typically these are contract agreements in software code between two actors."
  },
  {
    "term": "address",
    "description": "Address, represent users or actors on a blockchain.  They are typically public keys derived from private keys using cryptography.  The public address is published, but only the user with the private key can verify the validity of any written transactions or sign new transactions"
  },
  {
  "term": "proof of work",
  "description": "Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm, used by Bitcoin. This algorithm ensures that the first miner, in a race to complete complex mathematical problem, is allowed to create a new block.  Other miners then verify the POW solution by verifying the solution given"
  },
  {
  "term": "hashing",
  "description": "Hashing is a cryptographic function that creates a unique one way code that represents an input value.  A hash takes input and creates output that cannot be reverted back. It is typically used with digital signatures"
  },
  {
  "term": "double spend",
  "description": "Double spending as the name implies is the act of duplicating information typically by sending the same transaction twice. A blockchain solves this by ensuring the verification of every transaction, and reducing the double spending risk."
  },
  {
  "term": "digital signature",
  "description": "A digital signature is a way to authenticate information. For a blockchain, a digital signatures is used to sign a transactions by a users with their private key.  This proves that the signed transaction was created by the user"
  },
  {
  "term": "cryptography",
  "description": "Cryptography typically a way of secure communication and computing in the presents of adversaries through the use of code. Blockchain networks use cryptography to transfer asserts and ensure the immutability of the blockchain itself"

  "term": "ethereum",
  "description": "Ethereum is an blockchain project that is programmable by using computer code in the form of smart contracts. The native Ethereum token is called Ether. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) used to run complied code on the network"
  },
  {
  "term": "rollups",
  "description": "Rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions for collecting many transactions and then submitting them to the Ethereum mainnet chain in one transaction. This helps to improve speed and reduce cost.  They can be either zero-knowledge rollups or optimistic rollups which are both based on zero knowledge proofs cryptography"
  },
  {
    "term": "ethereum virtual machine",
    "description": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is a Turing complete, stack-based virtual machine that executes complied bytecode on the Ethereum network. Programs know as smart contracts can be written in a computer language know as Solidity which is compiled down to bytecode"
  },
  {
    "term": "gas",
    "description": "Gas is used within the Ethereum network to pay for transactions and to execute smart contracts. Used gas is said to have been burnt"
  },
  {
    "term": "ether",
    "description": "Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network.  Typically exchanged for for gas which is used for interactions with the network"

    "term": "non fungible token",
    "description": "A Non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique token which represents an asset. They can be the tokenised representations of digital or physical assets. DePin is a new technology that uses NFTs to authenticate and provide proof of ownership of physical goods. NFTs have lead to the of digital art market with unique items traded on exchanges"

    "term": "defi",
    "description": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is blockchain based finance using smart contracts, typically within the Ethereum network. DeFi is intended to provide improvements in profitability for investors by removing middlemen actors. Most financial instruments are contracts between two parties and therefore could be implement upon a blockchain network"
